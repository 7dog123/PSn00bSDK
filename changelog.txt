PSn00bSDK changelog


06-23-2019 by Lameguy64:

* LibPSn00b Run-time Library is officially version 0.10b.

* Reworked readme file with improved build instructions.

* libpsn00b: Added missing C extern groups for C++ compatibility in
  psxapi.h, stdlib.h and string.h.

* libpsn00b: Removed changelogs in the readmes of each libpsn00b library
  as its much easier to keep track of changes in a single changelog than
  scattering them across multiple changelogs.

* psxapi: Added Exec() function and EXEC struct.

* psxgpu: Added DrawPrim() function (uses direct I/O).

* psxgpu: VSync() function completely overhauled. Logic is now based on
  Sony's code but more efficient and can return total number of vblanks
  elapsed, number of hblanks since last call and wait up to n vblanks
  specified by an appropriate argument value. It will also generate a
  timeout when vblank interrupt stops working and would attempt to
  restart it.

* psxapi: Added gets() and getc() BIOS functions.

* psxapi: Corrected a putc()/putchar() discrepancy. putc() puts a character
  to a file stream, putchar() puts a character to stdout.

* Completely revised library reference manual with better formatting and
  more functions documented.

* psxgpu: Added DrawSyncCallback().

* psxgpu: Implemented DMA interrupt callback system with DMACallback()
  allowing to handle DMA interrupts very easily.

* libpsn00b: Implemented Serial I/O library (psxsio) with serial tty device
  (installed using AddSIO) and serial callback support. Serial library
  is also fully documented.

* psxgpu: Implemented IRQ callback system with InterruptCallback() allowing
  to set interrupt callbacks very easily.
  
* psxgpu: Implemented proper IRQ handler installed using HookEntryInt or
  SetCustomExitFromException() for handling VSync and other interrupts.
  ChangeClearPAD(0) must now be called after _InitPad() or vsync timeout
  will occur.

* libpsn00b: Started making local labels prefixed with .L instead of . making
  them not appear in symbol lists resulting in a cleaner symbol dump. Still
  not possible to do function-scope local labels like in ASMPSX because GAS
  syntax is ASS (or ASS GAS which is farts, GAS is farts).
  
* psxgpu: DrawSync() function now waits for DMA completion and GPU transfer
  ready instead of simply waiting for GPU transfer ready which is the likely
  cause of subtle GPU related timing issues, it also sets GPU DMA transfer
  mode to off afterwards. It can also read number of words remaining in DMA
  transfer if a0 is non-zero but it likely only returns the correct value on
  VRAM transfers. Exact way how DrawSync() returns the count in the official
  SDK is currently unknown.

* lzpack: Swapped a buffer length litteral with sizeof operator, fixing a
  stack overflow bug in some instances.



05-23-2019 by Lameguy64:

* Added dev notes.txt file in docs that includes notes about the many
  quirks about the console discovered during the development of this
  SDK project.

* Updated libn00bref.odf a little.

* Added turboboot example.

* Added rgb24 example.

* Got custom exit handler set using SetCustomExitFromException() (BIOS
 function B(19h)) working. Currently used to acknowledge VSync IRQ but
 actual VSync handling is still done with events and needs to be
 transferred to the custom exit handler. At least it lets BIOS
 controller functions to work now. See doc/dev notes.txt for details
 on how this handler behaves.

* Made stack usage in ResetGraph() less wasteful. You only need to
  allocate N words on stack based on N arguments of the function
  being called.

* VSync IRQ handling now done using a custom exit from exception handler.
  Actual VSync handling is yet to be moved to the custom exit handler
  though.

* Made stack usage in start.s of libc a lot less wasteful.

* Implemented controller support via BIOS functions (use _InitPad(),
  _StartPad() and _StopPad()). BIOS memory card functions may also
  work as well but its not tested yet.

* Removed duplicate initpad.s and initcard.s functions in psxapi.

* Added _InitCd() function to psxapi which is a safer version of _96_init()
  as it preserves other DMA channel settings. Use BIOS file functions such
  as open(), read() and close() with path names starting with cdrom:/ to
  access files from CD after calling _InitCd().
